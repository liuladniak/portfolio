          <p className="about-card__desc">
            I began my career with an engineering background, building a strong
            foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. As I
            transitioned into web development, I discovered a passion for
            creating efficient, high-quality web applications. Over time, I've
            worked on a wide range of projects - from front-end interfaces to
            full-stack applications - where my strong debugging skills and
            attention to detail have been invaluable in delivering reliable,
            polished results.
          </p>
          <p className="about-card__desc">
            Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve been driven by the belief that clean code
            and thoughtful design are essential for a great user experience. My
            approach is focused on transforming complex requirements into
            seamless, intuitive interfaces that meet user needs and align with
            business goals.
