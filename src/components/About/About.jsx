            Iâ€™m a UI/UX designer with a passion for solving complex problems
            through intuitive design. My journey started 5 years ago, and since
            then, I've worked with startups and established brands to bring
            their visions to life.

            Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with companies
            like ShopEase, FinTrack, and Insightly, focusing on user-centric
            design solutions.
